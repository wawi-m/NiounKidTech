Backend: Express.js and MongoDB



Purpose and Audience

NiounKid.tech aims to improve access to coding education for Nigerian children aged 5-18. By offering a localized and engaging platform, we inspire and empower young learners with essential coding skills.



My Personal Focus

As the front-end developer, my goal was to design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using React. The platform was developed with a responsive design, ensuring that kids can easily navigate and access learning materials.



Inspiration

The lack of access to quality educational resources in Nigeria inspired this project. NiounKid.tech aims to bridge this gap by providing children with the tools and knowledge to excel in the digital world.



Achievements

Developed a tailored coding curriculum for Nigerian children.

Built a user-friendly frontend with React and a scalable backend using Express.js and MongoDB.

Integrated a CMS like Contentful for easy updates to learning materials.



Technical Challenges

Ensuring scalability was a significant challenge. 



Lessons Learned

Technical Insights: Building a scalable application requires careful planning and a solid understanding of both frontend and backend technologies.

Areas for Improvement: Implementing automated testing earlier would have improved efficiency in catching and fixing bugs.

Personal Growth: The project reinforced the importance of collaboration, clear communication, and being adaptable to new technologies.



Future Directions

We plan to add more interactive elements, such as coding challenges and gamified experiences. Additionally, we aim to partner with schools and organizations in Nigeria to broaden our reach, ultimately making coding education accessible to every child in Nigeria.
